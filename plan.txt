Room renovation plan:
1: The first step of redecoration is to define the purpose of this operation. What are the goals I want to achieve by rearranging of my room.
2: The second step is to analyze the budget and the resources which I'll be able to use for my project. At this stage, I want to know the dimensions of my room and the objects in it.
3: The third step may be definition of a timeframe, assuming unforeseen problems.
4: In the fourth step I would order and buy new furniture or objects for my room knowing it could take a few days to get them.
5: The next step is the start of the real action. For example, if I decide to paint the walls in my room, I need to bring out the old furniture and objects or secure them so as not to damage them.
6: On this phase, I would clean up the mess I had made by painting the walls and repositioning the furniture to get a better vision of the new layout which I want to achieve.
7: The seven step is to bring in the new equipment of my room and to start assembling it if necessary.
8: Eight step is final arrangement of everything on site.
9: If everything is in order and the end result is satisfactory, I can do the final cleaning and enjoy the new room arrangement.
